Promise

The Promise represents the eventual Completion or failure of an asynchronus operation and its resulting value.

Promise.all()

Promise.any()

Promise.race()

Promise.allSettled()









```

PROMISE.all()



What it does:
It takes an iterable (like an array) of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the 
promises in the iterable have resolved or any of the promises have rejected.

Result: 
If all promises resolve, it returns an array of their resolved values. If any promise rejects, it rejects with the reason
of the first promise that rejected.
Use case:
When you want to ensure that multiple asynchronous operations have all completed successfully before proceeding.



Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(values => console.log(values))  // All resolved values
  .catch(error => console.log(error));   // First rejection


```






```

PROMISE.any()



What it does: It takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves as soon as any one of the promises 
in the iterable resolves. If all the promises reject, it rejects with an AggregateError.

Result: Resolves with the first fulfilled value. If all promises reject, it returns an AggregateError (collection of all rejection reasons).

Use case: When you want the result of the first successfully completed promise, ignoring failures unless all fail.


Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(value => console.log(value))  // First fulfilled value
  .catch(error => console.log(error)); // AggregateError if all rejected


```

```

PROMISE.race()



What it does: It takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise
 that resolves or rejects as soon as any one of the promises resolves or rejects.

Result: Resolves or rejects with the result of the first settled promise (whether resolved or rejected).

Use case: When you want the result of the first settled promise, whether it succeeds or fails.

Promise.race([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(value => console.log(value))   // First settled (resolved or rejected) value
  .catch(error => console.log(error)); // If first settled is rejected


```

```

PROMISE.allSettled()





What it does: It takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises 
in the iterable have settled (either resolved or rejected).

Result: It returns an array of objects that describe the outcome of each promise, whether it was resolved or rejected.

Use case: When you want to know the result of all promises, regardless of whether they succeeded or failed.


Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(results => console.log(results)); // Array of {status, value/reason}



```
